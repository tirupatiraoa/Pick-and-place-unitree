PROMPT = """You are an automated robotic shelf inspection system.
 
Input: A image of a pop shop rack containing multiple shelves with food and drink items.
 
Your tasks:
 
1. **Product Categorization**  
   Detect all visible items and group them into meaningful product categories.  
   Examples: "chips", "soft drinks", "milk", "biscuits", "chocolates", etc.  
   Return each category name only once.
 
2. **Empty Shelf Detection**  
   Identify shelves that contain no products at all.  
   Return the total number of empty shelves as an integer.
 
3. **Misplaced Item Detection**  
   If a shelf contains one or more items that do **not** belong to the dominant product category of that shelf, treat them as **misplaced items**.  
   For each misplaced item, return:
   - product name
   - bounding box in image coordinates: {x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max}
 
### Output Rules
Return **ONLY valid JSON** in the exact structure below.  
Do **NOT** include explanations, comments, markdown, or extra text.
